# University

Retrieves the classrooms (and every other room) of the University of Orl√©ans from a static database.

Rooms are grouped in room groups (e.g. a building's floor). Room groups are grouped in buildings. Buildings are grouped
in building groups (e.g. a campus).

## Endpoints

### Building group

building groups IDs instead. It is the most encompassing object of the tool.
